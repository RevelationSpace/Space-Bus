This library is meant for the Atmel ATTiny85 microcontroller and provides:
	- Interaction with a MAX485 compatible RS485 line driver
	- Transmission of bytes using the UART protocol
	- Clock recovery etc.

using these features of the MCU:
	- the USI DIN pin
	- the USI DOUT pin
	- a GPIO pin for data enable
	- timer/counter 0 and its interrupts
	- the pin change interrupt 0
