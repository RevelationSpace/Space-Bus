== SPACEBUS ==

== ABOUT ==
The SpaceBus protocol stack is a collection of several protocols intended for
medium-scale communication networks involving mostly small, embedded devices
such as microcontrollers. It is designed to be mostly small and simple, though
with enough power for simple automation tasks.

Further documentation and the specification can be found at:

== TODO ==

- write SBP (Space Bus Protocol) specification
- document wiring/pinout
- implement software
- design hardware:
   - psu
   - arbiters
   - simple SBP-enabled GPIO devices
   - ethernet<->space bus gateway/router
   - 'T-junction'

- and more...
